# Overview

Models are made up of metadata and queries that create tables and views, which can be used by other models or even outside of SQLMesh. They are defined in the `models/` directory of your SQLMesh project and live in `.sql` files.

SQLMesh will automatically determine the relationships among and lineage of your models by parsing SQL, so you don't have to worry about manually configuring dependencies.

## Example
The following is an example of a model defined in SQL. Note the following aspects:

  - Models can include descriptive information as comments, such as the first line.
  - The first non-comment statement in the file is the `MODEL` DDL.
  - The last non-comment statement is a `SELECT` query containing the logic that transforms the data.

```sql linenums="1"
-- Customer revenue computed and stored daily.
MODEL (
  name sushi.customer_total_revenue,
  owner toby,
  cron '@daily',
  grain customer_id
);

SELECT
  o.customer_id::TEXT,
  SUM(o.amount)::DOUBLE AS revenue
FROM sushi.orders AS o
GROUP BY o.customer_id;
```

## Conventions
SQLMesh attempts to infer as much as possible about your pipelines through SQL alone to reduce the cognitive overhead of switching to another format such as YAML.

One way it does this is by inferring a model's column names and data types from its SQL query. Disable this behavior for a model by manually specifying its column names and types in the [`columns` model property](#columns).

The `SELECT` expression of a model must follow certain conventions for SQLMesh to detect the necessary metadata to operate.

### Unique column names
The final `SELECT` of a model's query must contain unique column names.

### Explicit types
SQLMesh encourages explicit type casting in the final `SELECT` of a model's query. It is considered a best practice to prevent unexpected types in the schema of a model's table.

SQLMesh uses the postgres `x::int` syntax for casting; the casts are automatically transpiled to the appropriate format for the execution engine.

```sql linenums="1"
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 1 AS foo -- don't need to cast here
)
SELECT foo::int -- need to cast here because it's in the final select statement
```

### Inferrable names
The final `SELECT` of a model's query must have inferrable names or aliases.

Explicit aliases are recommended, but not required. The SQLMesh formatter will automatically add aliases to columns without them when the model SQL is rendered.

This example demonstrates non-inferrable, inferrable, and explicit aliases:

```sql linenums="1"
SELECT
  1, -- not inferrable
  x + 1, -- not inferrable
  SUM(x), -- not inferrable
  x, -- inferrable as x
  x::int, -- inferrable as x
  x + 1 AS x, -- explicitly x
  SUM(x) as x, -- explicitly x
```

### Model description and comments

Model files may contain SQL comments in a format supported in the model's SQL dialect. (Comments begin with `--` or are gated by `/*` and `*/` in most dialects.)

Some SQL engines support registering comments as metadata associated with a table or view. They may support table-level comments (e.g., "Revenue data for each customer") and/or column-level comments (e.g., "Customer's unique ID").

SQLMesh will automatically register comments if the engine supports it and the [connection's `register_comments` configuration](../../reference/configuration.md#connection) is `true` (`true` by default). Engines vary in their support for comments - see [tables below](#engine-comment-support).

#### Model comment

SQLMesh will register a comment specified before the `MODEL` DDL block as the table comment in the underlying SQL engine. If the [`MODEL` DDL `description` field](#description) is also specified, SQLMesh will register it with the engine instead.

#### Explicit column comments

You may explicitly specify column comments in the `MODEL` DDL `column_descriptions` field.

Specify them as a dictionary of key/value pairs separated by an equals sign `=`, where the column name is the key and the column comment is the value. For example:

```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="4-6"
MODEL (
  name sushi.customer_total_revenue,
  cron '@daily',
  column_descriptions (
    id = 'This is the ID column comment'
  )
);
```

If the `column_descriptions` key is present, SQLMesh will not detect and register inline column comments from the model query.

#### Inline column comments

If the `column_descriptions` key is not present in the `MODEL` definition, SQLMesh will automatically detect comments in a query's column selections and register each column's final comment in the underlying SQL engine.

For example, the physical table created for the following model definition would have:

1. The value of its `MODEL` DDL `description` field, "Revenue data for each customer", registered as a table comment in the SQL engine
2. The comment on the `customer_id` column definition, "Customer's unique ID", registered as a column comment for the table's `customer_id` column
3. The second comment on the `revenue` column definition, "Revenue from customer orders", registered as a column comment for the table's `revenue` column

```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="7 11 13"
-- The MODEL DDL 'description' field is present, so this comment will not be registered with the SQL engine
MODEL (
  name sushi.customer_total_revenue,
  owner toby,
  cron '@daily',
  grain customer_id,
  description 'Revenue data for each customer'
);

SELECT
  o.customer_id::TEXT, -- Customer's unique ID
  -- This comment will not be registered because another `revenue` comment is present
  SUM(o.amount)::DOUBLE AS revenue -- Revenue from customer orders
FROM sushi.orders AS o
GROUP BY o.customer_id;
```

#### Python models

[Python models](./python_models.md) are not parsed like SQL models, so column comments cannot be inferred from the model definition's inline comments.

Instead, specify them in the `@model` decorator's `column_descriptions` key. Specify them in a dictionary whose keys are column names and values are the columns' comments. SQLMesh will error if a column name is present that is not also in the `columns` key.

For example:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="8-10"
from sqlmesh import ExecutionContext, model

@model(
    "my_model.name",
    columns={
        "column_name": "int",
    },
    column_descriptions={
        "column_name": "The `column_name` column comment",
    },
)
def execute(
    context: ExecutionContext,
    start: datetime,
    end: datetime,
    execution_time: datetime,
    **kwargs: t.Any,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
```

#### Comment registration by object type

Only some tables/views have comments registered:

- Temporary tables are not registered
- Non-temporary tables and views in the physical layer (i.e., the schema named `sqlmesh__[project schema name]`) are registered
- Views in non-prod environments are not registered
- Views in the `prod` environment are registered

Some engines automatically pass comments from physical tables through to views that select from them. In those engines, views may display comments even if SQLMesh did not explicitly register them.

#### Engine comment support

Engines vary in their support for comments and their method(s) of registering comments. Engines may support one or both registration methods: in the `CREATE` command that creates the object or with specific post-creation commands.

In the former method, column comments are embedded in the `CREATE` schema definition - for example: `CREATE TABLE my_table (my_col INTEGER COMMENT 'comment on my_col') COMMENT 'comment on my_table'`. This means that all table and column comments can be registered in a single command.

In the latter method, separate commands are required for every comment. This may result in many commands: one for the table comment and one for each column comment. In some scenarios, SQLMesh is not able to use the former `CREATE` method and must issue separate commands. Because SQLMesh must use different methods in different situations and engines vary in their support of the methods, comments may not be registered for all objects.

This table lists each engine's support for `TABLE` and `VIEW` object comments:

| Engine        | `TABLE` comments | `VIEW` comments |

## Model properties
The `MODEL` DDL statement takes various properties, which are used for both metadata and controlling behavior.

Learn more about these properties and their default values in the [model configuration reference](../../reference/model_configuration.md#general-model-properties).

### name
:   Name specifies the name of the model. This name represents the production view name that the model outputs, so it generally takes the form of `"schema"."view_name"`. The name of a model must be unique in a SQLMesh project.

    When models are used in non-production environments, SQLMesh automatically prefixes the names. For example, consider a model named `"sushi"."customers"`. In production its view is named `"sushi"."customers"`, and in dev its view is named `"sushi__dev"."customers"`.

    Name is ***required*** and must be ***unique***, unless [name inference](../../reference/model_configuration.md#model-naming) is enabled.

### project
:   Project specifies the name of the project the model belongs to. Used in multi-repo SQLMesh deployments.

### kind
:   Kind specifies what [kind](model_kinds.md) a model is. A model's kind determines how it is computed and stored. The default kind is `VIEW` for SQL models, which means a view is created and your query is run each time that view is accessed. On the other hand, the default kind for Python models is `FULL`, which means that a table is created and the Python code is executed each time the model is evaluated. See [below](#incremental-model-properties) for properties that apply to incremental model kinds.

### audits
:   Audits specifies which [audits](../audits.md) should run after the model is evaluated.

### dialect
:   Dialect defines the SQL dialect of the model. By default, this uses the dialect in the [configuration file `model_defaults` `dialect` key](../../reference/configuration.md#model-configuration). All SQL dialects [supported by the SQLGlot library](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/dialects/__init__.py) are allowed.

### owner
:   Owner specifies who the main point of contact is for the model. It is an important field for organizations that have many data collaborators.

### stamp
:   An optional arbitrary string sequence used to create a new model version without changing the functional components of the definition.

### tags
:   Tags are one or more labels used to organize your models.

### cron
:   Cron is used to schedule when your model processes or refreshes data. It accepts a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or any of `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, or `@monthly`. All times are assumed to be UTC timezone by default.

### cron_tz
:   Cron timezone is used to specify the timezone of the cron. This is only used for scheduling and does not affect the intervals processed in an incremental model. For example, if a model is `@daily` with cron_tz `America/Los_Angeles`, it will run every day 12AM pacific time, however the `start` and `end` variables passed to the incremental model will represent the UTC date boundaries.

### interval_unit
:   Interval unit determines the temporal granularity with which time intervals are calculated for the model.

    By default, the interval unit is automatically derived from the [`cron`](#cron) expression and does not need to be specified.

    Supported values are: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `half_hour`, `quarter_hour`, and `five_minute`.

    #### Relationship to [`cron`](#cron)

    The SQLMesh scheduler needs two temporal pieces of information from a model: specific times when the model should run and the finest temporal granularity with which the data is processed or stored. The `interval_unit` specifies that granularity.

    If a model's `cron` parameter is a frequency like `@daily`, the run times and `interval_unit` are simple to determine: the model is ready to run at the start of the day, and its `interval_unit` is `day`. Similarly, a `cron` of `@hourly` is ready to run at the start of each hour, and its `interval_unit` is `hour`.

    If [`cron`](#cron) is specified with a cron expression, however, SQLMesh uses a more complex approach to derive the `interval_unit`.

    A [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) can generate complex time intervals, so SQLMesh does not parse it directly. Instead, it:

      1. Generates the next five run times from the cron expression (relative to the time of calculation)
      2. Calculates the duration of the intervals between those five values
      3. Determines the model's `interval_unit` as the largest interval unit value that is less than or equal to the minimum duration from (2)

    For example, consider a cron expression corresponding to "run every 43 minutes." Its `interval_unit` is `half_hour` because that is the largest `interval_unit` value *shorter* than 43 minutes. If the cron expression is "run every 67 minutes", its `interval_unit` is `hour` given the same logic.

    However, `interval_unit` does not have to be inferred from [`cron`](#cron) - you can specify it explicitly to customize how your backfill occurs.

    #### Specifying `interval_unit`

    Models often run on a regular cadence, where the same amount of time passes between each run and the same time length of data is processed in each run.

    For example, a model might run at midnight every day (1 run per day) to process the previous day's data (1 day's worth of data per run). The length of time between runs and the time length of data processed in each run are both 1 day (or both 2 days if you miss a run).

    However, the run cadence length and processed data length do not have to be the same.

    Consider a model that runs every day at 7:30am and processes data up until 7am today. The model's `cron` is a cron expression for "run every day at 7:30am," from which SQLMesh infers an `interval_unit` of `day`.

    What will happen when this model runs? First, SQLMesh will identify the most recent completed interval. The `interval_unit` was inferred to be `day`, so the last complete interval was yesterday. SQLMesh will not include any of today's data between 12:00am and 7:00am in the run.

    To include today's data, manually specify an `interval_unit` of `hour`. When the model runs at 7:30am, SQLMesh will identify the most recent completed `hour` interval as 6:00-7:00am and include data through that interval in the backfill.

    ```sql
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.up_until_7,
        kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
          time_column date_column,
        ),
        start '2024-11-01',
        cron '30 7 * * *', -- cron expression for "every day at 7:30am"
        interval_unit 'hour', -- backfill up until the most recently completed hour (rather than day)
      );
    ```

    !!! warning "Caution: complex use case"

        The example below is a complex use case that uses the `allow_partials` configuration option. We recommend that you do **NOT** use this option unless absolutely necessary.

        When partials are allowed, you will not be able to determine the cause of missing data. A pipeline problem and a correctly executed partial backfill both result in missing data, so you may not be able to differentiate the two.

        Overall, you risk sharing incomplete/incorrect data even when SQLMesh runs successfully. Learn more on the [Tobiko blog](https://tobikodata.com/data-completeness.html).

    This section configures a model that:

    - Runs every hour
    - Processes data for the last two days on every run
    - Processes the data that has accumulated so far today on every run

    Configuring this model requires letting SQLMesh process partially completed intervals by setting the model configuration `allow_partials True`.

    The data for partial intervals is only temporary - SQLMesh will reprocess the entire interval once it is complete.

    ```sql
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.demo,
        kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
          time_column date_column,
          lookback 2, -- 2 days of late-arriving data to backfill
        ),
        start '2024-11-01',
        cron '@hourly', -- run model hourly, not tied to the interval_unit
        allow_partials true, -- allow partial intervals so today's data is processed in each run
        interval_unit 'day', -- finest granularity of data to be time bucketed
    );
    ```

    The `lookback` is calculated in days because the model's `interval_unit` is specified as `day`.

### start
:   Start is used to determine the earliest time needed to process the model. It can be an absolute date/time (`2022-01-01`), or a relative one (`1 year ago`).

### end
:   End is used to determine the latest time needed to process the model. It can be an absolute date/time (`2022-01-01`), or a relative one (`1 year ago`).

### description
:   Optional description of the model. Automatically registered as a table description/comment with the underlying SQL engine (if supported by the engine).

### column_descriptions
:   Optional dictionary of [key/value pairs](#explicit-column-comments). Automatically registered as column descriptions/comments with the underlying SQL engine (if supported by the engine). If not present, [inline comments](#inline-column-comments) will automatically be registered.

### grain
:   A model's grain is the column or combination of columns that uniquely identify a row in the results returned by the model's query. If the grain is set, SQLMesh tools like `table_diff` are simpler to run because they automatically use the model grain for parameters that would otherwise need to be specified manually.

### grains
:   A model can define multiple grains if it has more than one unique key or combination of keys.

### references
:   References are non-unique columns or combinations of columns that identify a join relationship to another model.

    For example, a model could define a reference `account_id`, which would indicate that it can now automatically join to any model with an `account_id` grain. It cannot safely join to a table with an `account_id` reference because references are not unique and doing so would constitute a many-to-many join.

    Sometimes columns are named differently, in that case you can alias column names to a common entity name. For example `guest_id AS account_id` would allow a model with the column guest\_id to join to a model with the grain account\_id.

### depends_on
:   Depends on explicitly specifies the models on which the model depends, in addition to the ones automatically inferred by from the model code.

### table_format
:   Table format is an optional property for engines that support table formats like `iceberg` and `hive` where the physical file format is configurable. The intention is to define the table type using `table_format` and then the on-disk format of the files within the table using `storage_format`.

    Note that this property only implemented for engines that allow the `table_format` to be configured independently of the `storage_format`.

### storage_format
:   Storage format is a property for engines such as Spark or Hive that support storage formats such as `parquet` and `orc`. Note that some engines dont make a distinction between `table_format` and `storage_format`, in which case `storage_format` is used and `table_format` is ignored.

### partitioned_by
:   Partitioned by plays two roles. For most model kinds, it is an optional property for engines that support table partitioning such as Spark or BigQuery.

    For the [`INCREMENTAL_BY_PARTITION` model kind](./model_kinds.md#incremental_by_partition), it defines the partition key used to incrementally load data.

    It can specify a multi-column partition key or modify a date column for partitioning. For example, in BigQuery you could partition by day by extracting the day component of a timestamp column `event_ts` with `partitioned_by TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(event_ts, DAY)`.

### clustered_by
:   Clustered by is an optional property for engines such as Bigquery that support clustering.

### columns
:   By default, SQLMesh [infers a model's column names and types](#conventions) from its SQL query. Disable that behavior by manually specifying all column names and data types in the model's `columns` property.

    **WARNING**: SQLMesh may exhibit unexpected behavior if the `columns` property includes columns not returned by the query, omits columns returned by the query, or specifies data types other than the ones returned by the query.

    For example, this shows a seed model definition that includes the `columns` key. It specifies the data types for all columns in the file: the `holiday_name` column is data type `VARCHAR` and the `holiday_date` column is data type `DATE`.

    ```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="6-9"
    MODEL (
      name test_db.national_holidays,
      kind SEED (
        path 'national_holidays.csv'
      ),
      columns (
        holiday_name VARCHAR,
        holiday_date DATE
      )
    );
    ```

    NOTE: Specifying column names and data types is required for [Python models](../models/python_models.md) that return DataFrames.

### physical_properties
:   Previously named `table_properties`

    Physical properties is a key-value mapping of arbitrary properties that are applied to the model table / view in the physical layer. Note the partitioning details and `creatable_type` which overrides the kind of model/view created. In this case it creates a `TRANSIENT TABLE`. While `creatable_type` is generic, other properties are adapter specific so check the engine documentation for those. For example:

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
      ...,
      physical_properties (
        partition_expiration_days = 7,
        require_partition_filter = true,
        creatable_type = TRANSIENT
      )
    );

    ```

### virtual_properties
:   Virtual properties is a key-value mapping of arbitrary properties that are applied to the model view in the virtual layer. Note the partitioning details and `creatable_type` which overrides the kind of model/view created. In this case it creates a `SECURE VIEW`. While `creatable_type` is generic, other properties are adapter specific so check the engine documentation for those. For example:

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
      ...,
      virtual_properties (
        creatable_type = SECURE,
        labels = [('test-label', 'label-value')]
      )
    );

    ```

### session_properties
:   Session properties is a key-value mapping of arbitrary properties specific to the target engine that are applied to the engine session.

### allow_partials
:   Indicates that this model can be executed for partial (incomplete) data intervals.

    By default, each model processes only complete intervals to prevent common errors caused by partial data. The size of the interval is determined by the model's [interval_unit](#interval_unit).

    Setting `allow_partials` to `true` overrides this behavior, indicating that the model may process a segment of input data that is missing some of the data points.

    NOTE: To force the model to run every time, set `allow_partials` to `true` and use the `--ignore-cron` argument: `sqlmesh run --ignore-cron`. Simply setting `allow_partials` to `true` does not guarantee that the model will run on every `sqlmesh run` command invocation. The model’s configured `cron` schedule is still respected, even when partial intervals are allowed. 

    Similarly, using `--ignore-cron` without setting `allow_partials` to `true` does not guarantee the model will run every time. Depending on the time of day, the interval might not be complete and ready for execution, even when ignoring the `cron` schedule. Therefore, both are required to ensure that the model runs on every `sqlmesh run` invocation.

### enabled
:   Whether the model is enabled. This attribute is `true` by default. Setting it to `false` causes SQLMesh to ignore this model when loading the project.

### physical_version
:   Pins the version of this model's physical table to the given value.

    NOTE: This can only be set for forward-only models.

### gateway
:   Specifies the gateway to use for the execution of this model. When not specified, the default gateway is used.

### optimize_query
:   Whether the model's query should be optimized. All SQL models are optimized by default. Setting this
to `false` causes SQLMesh to disable query canonicalization & simplification. This should be turned off only if the optimized query leads to errors such as surpassing text limit.

!!! warning
    Turning off the optimizer may prevent column-level lineage from working for the affected model and its descendants, unless all columns in the model's query are qualified and it contains no star projections (e.g. `SELECT *`).

### validate_query
:   Whether the model's query will be validated at compile time. This attribute is `false` by default. Setting it to `true` causes SQLMesh to raise an error instead of emitting warnings. This will display invalid columns in your SQL statements along with models containing `SELECT *` that cannot be automatically expanded to list out all columns. This ensures SQL is verified locally before time and money are spent running the SQL in your data warehouse.

!!! warning
    This flag is deprecated as of v.0.159.7+ in favor of the [linter](../../guides/linter.md). To preserve validation during compilation, the [built-in rules](../../guides/linter.md#built-in-rules) that check for correctness should be [configured](../../guides/linter.md#rule-violation-behavior) to error severity.

### ignored_rules
: Specifies which linter rules should be ignored/excluded for this model.

### formatting
:   Whether the model will be formatted. All models are formatted by default. Setting this to `false` causes SQLMesh to ignore this model during `sqlmesh format`. 

## Incremental Model Properties

These properties can be specified in an incremental model's `kind` definition.

Some properties are only available in specific model kinds - see the [model configuration reference](../../reference/model_configuration.md#incremental-models) for more information and a complete list of each `kind`'s properties.

### time_column
:   Time column is a required property for incremental models. It is used to determine which records to overwrite when doing an incremental insert. Time column can have an optional format string specified in the SQL dialect of the model.

    Engines that support partitioning, such as Spark and BigQuery, use the time column as the model's partition key. Multi-column partitions or modifications to columns can be specified with the [`partitioned_by` property](#partitioned_by).

    !!! tip "Important"

        The `time_column` variable should be in the UTC time zone - learn more [here](./model_kinds.md#timezones).

### batch_size
:   Batch size is used to backfill incremental data when the number of intervals to backfill is too large for the engine to execute in a single pass. It allows you to process sets of intervals in batches small enough to execute on your system. The `batch_size` parameter determines the maximum number of [`interval_unit`s](#interval_unit) of data to run in a single job.

    For example, consider a model with an `@hourly` [`cron`](#cron) that has not run in 3 days. Because its [`cron`](#cron) is `@hourly`, its [`interval_unit`](#interval_unit) is `hour`.

    First, let's calculate the total number of outstanding intervals to backfill: 3 days of unprocessed data * 24 hours/day = 72 `hour` intervals.

    Now we can calculate the number of jobs for different `batch_size` values with this formula:

      Number of Intervals / `batch_size` = Number of jobs to run

    Let's look at the number of jobs for a few different `batch_size` values:
      - `batch_size` not specified: scheduler will spawn 1 job that processes all 72 intervals (SQLMesh's default behavior)
      - `batch_size` of 1: scheduler will spawn [72 `hour` intervals / 1 interval per job] = 72 jobs
      - `batch_size` of 12: scheduler will spawn [72 `hour` intervals / 12 intervals per job] = 6 jobs

### batch_concurrency
:   The maximum number of [batches](#batch_size) that can run concurrently for this model. If not specified, the concurrency is only constrained by the number of concurrent tasks set in the connection settings.

### lookback
:   Lookback is used with [incremental by time range](model_kinds.md#incremental_by_time_range) and [incremental by unique key](model_kinds.md#incremental_by_unique_key) models to capture late-arriving data. It allows the model to access data points not in the time interval currently being processed.

    It must be a positive integer and specifies how many [`interval_unit`s](#interval_unit) intervals before the current interval the model should include.

    For example, consider a model with cron `@daily` ([`interval_unit`](#interval_unit) `day`). If the model specified a `lookback` of 7, SQLMesh would include the 7 days prior to the time interval being processed. A model with cron `@weekly` and `lookback` of 7 would include the 7 weeks prior to the time interval being processed.

    Or consider a model whose cron expression is "run every 6 hours" (`0 */6 * * *`). SQLMesh calculates its [`interval_unit`](#interval_unit) as `hour`. The `lookback` value is calculated in `interval_units`, so a `lookback` of 1 would include the 1 hour prior to the time interval being processed.

### forward_only
:   Set this to true to indicate that all changes to this model should be [forward-only](../plans.md#forward-only-plans).

### on_destructive_change
:   What should happen when a change to a [forward-only model](../../guides/incremental_time.md#forward-only-models) or incremental model in a [forward-only plan](../plans.md#forward-only-plans) causes a destructive modification to the table schema (i.e., requires dropping an existing column).

    SQLMesh checks for destructive changes at plan time based on the model definition and run time based on the model's underlying physical tables.

    Must be one of the following values: `allow`, `warn`, or `error` (default).

### disable_restatement
:   Set this to true to indicate that [data restatement](../plans.md#restatement-plans) is disabled for this model.

### auto_restatement_cron
:   A cron expression that determines when SQLMesh should automatically restate this model. Restatement means re-evaluating either a number of last intervals (controlled by [`auto_restatement_intervals`](#auto_restatement_intervals)) for model kinds that support it or the entire model for model kinds that don't. Downstream models that depend on this model will also be restated. The auto-restatement is only applied when running the `sqlmesh run` command against the production environment.

    A common use case for auto-restatement is to periodically re-evaluate a model (less frequently than the model's cron) to account for late-arriving data or dimension changes. However, relying on this feature is generally not recommended, as it often indicates an underlying issue with the data model or dependency chain. Instead, users should prefer setting the [`lookback`](#lookback) property to handle late-arriving data more effectively.

    Unlike the [`lookback`](#lookback) property, which only controls the time range of data scanned, auto-restatement rewrites all previously processed data for this model in the target table.

    For model kinds that don't support [`auto_restatement_intervals`](#auto_restatement_intervals) the table will be re-created from scratch.

    Models with [`disable_restatement`](#disable_restatement) set to `true` will not be restated automatically even if this property is set.

    **NOTE**: Models with this property set can only be [previewed](../plans.md#data-preview-for-forward-only-changes) in development environments, which means that the data computed in those environments will not be reused in production.

    ```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="6"
    MODEL (
      name test_db.national_holidays,
      cron '@daily',
      kind INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY (
        unique_key key,
        auto_restatement_cron '@weekly',
      )
    );
    ```

### auto_restatement_intervals
:   The number of last intervals to restate automatically. This is only applied in conjunction with [`auto_restatement_cron`](#auto_restatement_cron).

    If not specified, the entire model will be restated.

    This property is only supported for the `INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` model kind.

    ```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="7"
    MODEL (
      name test_db.national_holidays,
      cron '@daily',
      kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
        time_column event_ts,
        auto_restatement_cron '@weekly',
        auto_restatement_intervals 7, -- automatically restate the last 7 days of data
      )
    );
    ```

## Macros
Macros can be used for passing in parameterized arguments such as dates, as well as for making SQL less repetitive. By default, SQLMesh provides several predefined macro variables that can be used. Macros are used by prefixing with the `@` symbol. For more information, refer to [macros](../macros/overview.md).

## Statements
Models can have additional statements that run before and/or after the main query. They can be useful for loading things such as [UDFs](../glossary.md#user-defined-function-udf) or cleaning up after a model query has run.

In general, pre-statements statements should only be used for preparing the main query. They should not be used for creating or altering tables, as this could lead to unpredictable behavior if multiple models are running simultaneously.

```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="5-7"
MODEL (
...
);

-- Additional statements preparing for main query
ADD JAR s3://special_udf.jar;
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION UDF AS 'my.jar.udf';

SELECT UDF(x)::int AS x
FROM y;
```

Additional statements can also be provided after the main query, in which case they will run after each evaluation of the SELECT query. Note that the model query must end with a semi-colon prior to the post-statements.

```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="10-11"
MODEL (
...
);

...

SELECT UDF(x)::int AS x
FROM y;

-- Cleanup statements
DROP TABLE temp_table;
```
